    <h1>5-Year Research Agenda</h1>
    <p>
      Advanced structural systems, infrastructure resilience modeling,
      and AI-integrated engineering frameworks for next-generation megaproject environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Vision (2026–2031)</h2>
    <p>
      The core objective of this research agenda is to develop
      integrated structural intelligence systems capable of
      supporting sovereign-scale infrastructure transformation.
      Emphasis is placed on resilience modeling,
      nonlinear structural behavior under extreme events,
      and AI-assisted decision architectures.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Proposed PhD Direction</h2>
    <p>
      The proposed doctoral research will focus on performance-based
      seismic design optimization using computational simulation,
      probabilistic collapse modeling, and machine-learning-assisted
      structural evaluation techniques.
    </p>
