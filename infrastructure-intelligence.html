    Systems-level analytical modeling for resilient, high-complexity

    <h2>Strategic Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Infrastructure operates as an interconnected system of structural,
      transportation, utility, and energy networks.
      Isolated asset analysis is insufficient for evaluating systemic stability.
      Sali Labs applies integrated modeling logic to understand
      how large-scale infrastructure systems behave under uncertainty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Systems-Level Modeling</h2>
    <p>
      Analytical frameworks are developed at the network scale,
      incorporating nonlinear structural behavior,
      probabilistic risk patterns,
      and cross-system interdependencies.
      The objective is to assess overall systemic resilience
      rather than component-level performance alone.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Resilience & Risk Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Resilience is defined as the ability of infrastructure systems
      to absorb disruption, adapt under stress,
      and recover functional continuity.
      Modeling integrates collapse mechanisms,
      cascading failure pathways,
      and long-horizon structural response scenarios.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>AI-Augmented Analytical Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is utilized as a computational enhancement layer,
      supporting predictive modeling,
      anomaly detection,
      and scenario simulation.
      Human engineering judgment remains central to
      analytical interpretation and strategic decision logic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Application Scope</h2>
    <p>
      The infrastructure intelligence framework is designed for
      high-complexity development environments including
      large-scale urban systems,
      strategic national infrastructure programs,
      and megaproject ecosystems requiring
      systemic risk evaluation and modeling precision.
