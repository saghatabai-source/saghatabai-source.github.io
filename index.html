  <h2>Scalable Engineering Intelligence Platform</h2>

  <p>
    Sali Labs is structured as a modular engineering intelligence platform 
    designed for scalable deployment across infrastructure domains. Rather 
    than operating as a project-based entity, the laboratory develops system-level 
    architectures capable of regional and global expansion.
